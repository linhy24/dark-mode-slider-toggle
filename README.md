## Code Explaination

## Usage

### Create CSS files for light/dark mode

The very basic logic of switch the page between light and dark mode is changing the color of text, background, and all other elements when color theme is changed. In order to do that, you change the corresponding CSS elements. This project as well as the original project from GoogleChromeLabs both use two separate CSS files for light and dark mode.
